### 1-node

The file contains data gathered when only a single node is being used in the pipeline. The graphs are in files:
* 1-node-LR.png
* 1-node-Depth.png
* 1-node-RGB.png

### 2-nodes

The file contains data gathered when 2 nodes are used in the pipeline with varying combinations. The graphs are in files:
* 2-nodes-LRDepth.png
* 2-nodes-RGBLR.png
* 2-nodes-RGBDepth.png

### 3-nodes

The file contains data gathered when 3 nodes are used in the pipeline. The graphs are in files:
* 3-nodes.png

### Multi-cam RGB

The file contains data gathered when only a single node of RGB encoded data is being used with varying number of cameras. The graphs are in files:
* multi-RGB.png

> NOTE: Since the cpu utilizations are all very similar, there is a single graph of LeonOS and LeonRT readings.

### Multi-cam 3 nodes

The file contains data gathered when 3 node pipeline is being used with varying number of cameras. The graphs are in files:
* multi-fullpipeline.png
