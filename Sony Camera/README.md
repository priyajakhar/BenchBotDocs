## Visual Studio

This sets up Visual Studio Community 2022 which is an IDE (not to be mistaken with Visual Studio Code which is a rich text editor)

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing, editing, and debugging websites, web, and mobile applications as well as cloud services.
Because it's an IDE, programming utilities like a debugger, compiler, intellisence, and more are all bundled into it.
It has 3 editions â€“ community, professional, and enterprise. The community version is free, while the professional and enterprise are not.
